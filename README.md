# Extraction of Medication Information From Prescription Drug Labels using Deep learning with PaddleOCR and Python

In this project, I implemented an OCR model using PaddleOCR, a deep learning OCR framework, to extract medication details such as drug names, dosages, and instructions from prescription drug labels with high accuracy (>90%). I utilized Python for coding and OpenCV for reading input image files and performing color space conversion. The extracted details from prescription drug labels were annotated using PaddleOCR's draw_ocr method, and the annotated images were visualized using Matplotlib.

### Summary of the steps:

- Installing the requirements
- Import necessary libraries
- Initializing the OCR model and defining the image path
- Performing OCR on the image
- Processing and displaying the OCR results
- Visualizing the results
